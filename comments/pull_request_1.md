## Request for Custom Time Duration Feature

I would like to request the implementation of a custom time duration feature for the timer in this pull request. The requirements for this feature are as follows:

- The timer should allow users to set custom durations (not just preset values).
- Users should be able to input custom minutes and seconds.
- There should be validation for time input to ensure correctness.
- The timer must work with any custom duration specified by the user.

This is a critical missing feature that needs to be included in the implementation.
